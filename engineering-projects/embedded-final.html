Go-Kart"></p><h2 id="introduction" tabindex="-1">Introduction: <a class="header-anchor" href="#introduction" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Introduction:&quot;">​</a></h2><p>For the Embedded Systems final project, our group created an electric Go-Kart with the use of the MSP432P401R microcontroller and BoosterPack MKII. This Electro-Kart allows a user to sit on it and safely ride it, just like a normal Go-Kart. The difference here is that it is an all electric Go-Kart that uses a wireless controller instead of the usual steering wheel and pedals. One big goal of this project was to make sure that this was safe and reliable to ride by having safety checks for the wireless component, a physical turn off switch, and robust hardware. We did all this by incorporating embedded concepts learned from class along with new concepts and circuitry design learned through research.</p><p><strong>This project won First Place for Fall 2017&#39;s Embedded Systems Class at University of Colorado Boulder.</strong></p><h3 id="video-link-showcasing-the-electric-go-kart" tabindex="-1"><a href="https://youtu.be/9J7c60GSMkI" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Video link showcasing the Electric Go-Kart</a> <a class="header-anchor" href="#video-link-showcasing-the-electric-go-kart" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;[Video link showcasing the Electric Go-Kart](https://youtu.be/9J7c60GSMkI)&quot;">​</a></h3><h3 id="images" tabindex="-1">Images: <a class="header-anchor" href="#images" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Images:&quot;">​</a></h3><p><img src="/assets/front.4d7cff3f.jpg" alt="Front of Go-Kart"></p><p><img src="/assets/back.56640f67.jpg" alt="Back of Go-Kart"></p><p><img src="/assets/ecen2440prize.6d953327.jpg" alt="Prize"></p><h2 id="implementation" tabindex="-1">Implementation: <a class="header-anchor" href="#implementation" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Implementation:&quot;">​</a></h2><p>The following implementations were divided into two different categories. Firstly, there is the hardware and secondly the software.</p><p>Hardware Block Diagram: <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1l7-Fnbb38Op6hISRjfihspLub2xPv3wl/view" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Link</a></p><p>Software Flow Diagram: <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1rWAXqVIRYYwtYjQ_b6t-H40YZpuccp2R/view" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Link</a></p><h3 id="hardware-how-the-electro-kart-works" tabindex="-1">Hardware/How the Electro-Kart works: <a class="header-anchor" href="#hardware-how-the-electro-kart-works" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Hardware/How the Electro-Kart works:&quot;">​</a></h3><p><ins>Description of the Circuit:</ins></p><p>The hardware as we see below is comprised of a 12V, 18 amp-hour battery connected to a power train (power and ground). There is a kill switch connected to the front as a safety feature and not to exhaust the battery life. There are 40 amp fuses located behind the power train to avoid damaging the parts if there is too much current that is being outputted. The signal sent was from the GPIO wiring from the slave which sent the PWM (Pulse Width Modulation) waves.</p><p>The PWM wave are then sent to the two speed controllers. When the speed controllers receive their unique PWM waves from the MSP and then change the voltage going into the motors based on the duty cycle of the wave. The first part of the motors are two switches connected to the speed controllers at the front of the kart. The switches reverse the polarity of the current which in turn causes the motors to go forward or backward. The motors then spin faster or slower based on the size of the voltage flowing into them. However, the problems with the speed controller and varying speed is discussed in the conclusion.</p><p>In addition, we had to implement a way of doing reverse which was originally planned to be done with relays. Unfortunately, we couldn’t get the relays to work with our circuit so we improvised and found two DPDT switches which allowed the robot (with a flip) to move forwards and backwards. This also allowed the robot to turn 360° demonstrating its dexterity and 1 maneuverability. The speed controller then connected the motors which allowed the motion to act. The hardware is shown below (Figure 1).</p><p><img src="/assets/figure1.4d4e48b2.jpg" alt="Figure 1"></p><p style="text-align:center;">Figure 1: Circuit of Electro-Kart</p><p><ins>Controller - Master:</ins> Here we have the main controller of the Electro-Kart that used an MSP432P401R microcontroller with the BoosterPack, HC-05 Bluetooth module, custom PCB, and a 3D printed enclosure. The MSP432 with BoosterPack incorporates the joystick as the way of controlling the Electro-Kart. We also have a button on the BoosterPack that is used for data analysis (More detail later on). At the software level, we divided the joystick into 9 different sections (More details in Software). The section that the joystick is located is what is sent out. We also had a heartbeat function which includes a test byte that is sent to the Slave MSP to make sure that data is being sent. This is used for safety reasons. The joystick locations and heartbeat data is sent through UART and to the HC-05 Bluetooth module. This data is sent to another HC-05 Bluetooth module which is connected to an MSP432 on the Electro-Kart. Also the main controller incorporates a custom PCB. The PCB layout and diagrams for the Master are shown below:</p><p><img src="/assets/figure2.4720f1db.jpg" alt="Figure 2"></p><p style="text-align:center;">Figure 2: Controller with Master MSP and BoosterPack</p><p><img src="/assets/figure3.ca5b0c75.jpg" alt="Figure 3"></p><p style="text-align:center;">Figure 3: Master PCB Layout (Using Altium)</p><p><img src="/assets/figure4.cdc07b84.jpg" alt="Figure 4"></p><p style="text-align:center;">Figure 4: Master PCB Schematic (Using Altium)</p><p><img src="/assets/figure5.04c6169a.jpg" alt="Figure 5"></p><p style="text-align:center;">Figure 5: Master PCB (Printed at Tim’s Lab in the ITLL of CU Boulder). There are globs of solder because the printer did not catch the thin lines that connect the copper to the common ground polygon pour. Connected is a working voltage regulator that is taking in a 9V battery to output 5 volts. </p><p><ins>MSP432 - Slave:</ins> The joystick data is received from the Master Bluetooth module to Slave HC-05 Bluetooth module. At the software level, the Slave module is taking the received joystick data and based off of that data, outputting the correct Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) waves through the circuit and to the motors. Also, there is the heartbeat byte that is received. If there is no heartbeat byte that is being received which indicates that there is a disconnection between the Bluetooth modules, the PWM function receives a 0 which means stop the motors from running.</p><p><img src="/assets/figure6.3eb165c8.png" alt="Figure 6"></p><p style="text-align:center;">Figure 6: Slave PCB Layout (Using Altium)</p><p><img src="/assets/figure7.a6651df2.jpg" alt="Figure 7"></p><p style="text-align:center;">Figure 7: Slave PCB Schematic (Using Altium)</p><p><img src="/assets/figure8.a3f38414.jpg" alt="Figure 8"></p><p style="text-align:center;">Figure 8: Slave PCB (Printed at Tim’s Lab in the ITLL of CU Boulder). There are globs of solder near the bluetooth devices due to a minor accident where both modules had to be swapped. A second voltage regulator/9V battery was not necessary for the slave. </p><h3 id="software" tabindex="-1">Software: <a class="header-anchor" href="#software" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Software:&quot;">​</a></h3><p><ins>PWM-Slave:</ins> Main Wave Generator. TIMER_A0-&gt;CCR[x] allows for different duty cycles to be generated that varies the output of the speed controller. TIMER_A0-&gt;CCR[1] uses P2.4, while CCR[2] uses P2.5. This information is found in the gpio1.c file. Using enumerations for the duty cycle readings. The enumeration function is found in timer header file. The speed controller needs at least a 1,000 Hz Frequency in order to be read. 2,000 Hz is the max. Retriever-Slave: Bluetooth value sorter and code feedback for bluetooth state. This function implements a heartbeat timer where the MSP &amp; Bluetooth Master Device sends a consistent 0xA every 200ms. This means there should be about 4 0xA&#39;s being sent before counter == 1000. The filtered value being returned will only return a value between 0-9, where every other value is considered as garbage.</p><p><ins>gpio_LEDout-Slave/Master:</ins> Different inputs for specific color combinations. This function specifically turns specific lights on or off on the MSP (Not the Boosterpack). Bits 0, 1, 2 are used.</p><p><ins>UART_configure-Slave/Master:</ins> Configured at 115200 Baud Rate to match the master MSP432, Master HC-05, and Slave HC-05.</p><p><ins>Bluetooth_config-Slave/Master:</ins> This function uses the same AT commands that are used to configure the HC-05 with an Arduino. Since the AT commands are sent over UART, we took that received data over UART and used it in this function to configure the bluetooth modules. In order to send these commands, this function needs to be called while bluetooth modules are in AT command mode meaning the Enable pins are high and there should be a slow consistent blinking LED.</p><p><ins>Port3_IRQHandler-Master:</ins> General PORT3 Interrupt Handler. This function primarily deals with a byte through UART to be sent via the bus in order to output feedback the slave MSP. Please note that the bottom button acts funny and reads Bits 5 and 6 making 0x30 for some odd reason. A workaround just ignores that BIT6 and does whatever it needs with P3.5.</p><p><ins>Joystick Location-Master:</ins> Default position reads for x=8310 and for y=8140. Channelx takes an input from main that compares values for the left and right movement. Channel-y takes an input from main that compares values for the up and down movement. Prioritizing forward movement on top, backwards and 180 turning on bottom. Note that the joystick is not a complete matrix of 2^14x2^14 things (including the negatives of course). There is a weird cutoff that needed to be made specifically for Brandon&#39;s white LCD Boosterpack MKII.</p><p><ins>Timer A0 Interrupt Handler-Master:</ins> Timer A0_0 Interrupt Handler. This function sends a byte of 0xA every 200ms based off of the configuration above.</p><h2 id="results" tabindex="-1">Results: <a class="header-anchor" href="#results" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Results:&quot;">​</a></h2><p>For data analysis, we used another HC-05 module on the slave which could be connected by any other device like a computer or a phone. Figures 9-12 shows the data sent out from the slave and their descriptions. All of this is displayed through RealTerm.</p><p><img src="/assets/RTerror.9961ab13.jpg" alt="Figure 9"></p><p style="text-align:center;">Figure 9: A continuous output is being sent via bluetooth to the serial terminal to warn the user that there is no bluetooth connection. </p><p><img src="/assets/RT2.10fa2a09.jpg" alt="Figure 10"></p><p style="text-align:center;">Figure 10: Outputs of the Joystick Quadrants from the Slave MSP to the Master MSP.

This would certainly be a great prototype for a defense contractors. Due to its specifications of remote capabilities and nature of cost (very low), this project could be mass produced and more efficient. A future addition to this robot would be the implementations of “VIVE” drivability. This would include a Pixy-Cam that would stream footage at the front of the chassis. Then processes to a vive that can be driven with a reality headset and be mobile. Controlling and viewing first person would escalate the drone industry defensively and commercially.</p><h2 id="conclusion" tabindex="-1">Conclusion: <a class="header-anchor" href="#conclusion" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Conclusion:&quot;">​</a></h2><p>The Electrokart features full functioning omnidirectional capabilities and extensive firmware/ software. Using Bluetooth modules connected via UART (Universal asynchronous receiver transmitter) allow the master and slave to communicate. The master is comprised as the wireless remote control with the joystick conducting the direction. The slave is used to register the values from the master and output PWM (Pulse width modulation) waves to the speed controller. Once the speed controller reads the frequency and duty cycle of the PWM waves, it transfers the chirp to the motors. In order to log data, another Bluetooth module was connected on the slave and through UART is transferred to RealTerm in order to show if the connection was successful.</p><p>The circuitry of the Electrokart includes crucial elements for it to function. The battery was the hardest to gauge, it was outputting 12 volts with 18 Amp-hours. When connecting the battery to the circuit, a power train for power and ground connected the fuses which were attached to the speed controller (in case it blew or shorted). The speed controller was connected to polarity switches which means that when the cart moved forwards we could reverse the direction by flipping the switches.</p><p>To make this project work, we first spent 2 weeks planning and researching the parts and how to incorporate them. Originally, this was supposed to be a robot, but did not find that it was applicable or really had a purpose so we iterated on the design and made a electric Go-Kart. We went through this project step-by-step by trying to get one motor to work with the power supplies from the lab along with making joystick to work with our code. Then, gradually through a lot of time and trial and error, we solved each problem one at a time which eventually resulted in our final product. We tried spending as much time early including the first day of Fall break to make sure we had enough time to account for any problems we would encounter when the deadline was approaching. In the end, we did have enough time and we were able to make the electric Go-Kart aesthetically pleasing and presentable.</p><p>The electric Go-Kart was a working success. However, there were problems that were encountered during the process. The first major problem was power output through the speed controller to the motors. With a strict power regulation input for the speed controller, the resistance changes due to the change in duty cycles were consequential to work with. Plugging the motor straight to a power supply (12V/12A max) allowed the motor to freely spin, pulling a max of 12V and 8-9A. However, with the addition of the Vector 884 Speed Controller, a 12V/.1A was only being pushed. With a literal kick to the wheel, the motors were able to freely move at a constant speed pulling the same 12V-8-9A. One of the major problems discovered here was the motor first needed a spike in power in order to start. This is due to the extra torque needed at the beginning, while less of a torque is required when spinning.</p><p>Multiple ideas were implemented to fix this problem. First, having an inductor/capacitor combination was implemented as an idea to offset the output slightly in order to give a kick to the motor. A second idea was to put a large enough capacitor in parallel with the speed controller output to give the initial power needed to start the motor. The third idea was similar to the second which implemented the same capacitor but before the speed controller. The fourth idea was to change the calibration settings within the speed controller with varying frequencies being outputted (since the speed controller has a built in relay to reverse polarities of the motor). The final implementation was to buy a battery large enough to output 12V and at least 18A (for the two motors). This last idea worked by buying a lead battery (12V/20Ah/200 cold cranking Amps), however, this issued another problem.</p><p>The second discovered problem is the speed controller can not regulate a high current. Without regulation, duty cycles are useless to this project as a 5% duty cycle does not have enough power to kickstart the motor, but going from a 95% duty cycle down to 5% does not change the output speed.</p><p>Again, multiple methods were implemented to solve this problem. First, downscaling the project to a smaller 6V/1.5A motor proved our theory correctly with a prototype. The speed controller allowed for different duty cycles to change the rotation speed and sound of the motor. With this, we bought a 12V/18Ah battery that matched the specifications of the initial battery that we had to start the project. This new battery only allowed for a smaller torque and slower speeds when tested, but not a varied speed. With a deadline approaching, we ran with the idea and did actual test outside. We knew we couldn’t vary the speeds, but could only turn the motors on or off (together and separately). This means that to turn left, the right motor has to be on full power while the second one off, and vice versa for right. Even with a lack of variable speed, the motor turned without stutter and still allowed for the user to have complete control of the vehicle.</p><p>Besides power, bluetooth was a major stepping stone for the group. Safety was stressed for this project, and losing control of a robot because of missent/misread information, disconnect issues, etc. was a consistent problem. Like said above, a heartbeat timer was implemented for a specific reason. When sending data through bluetooth, there is always a consistent ASCII square wave being transmitted from the Master to the Slave MSP. If pairing was cut between the two devices, a consistent 3.3V would be sent. Because this straight line cannot be read as an ASCII value, the current holder within the bluetooth receive function cannot update the value to NULL. This resulted in the problem in if ‘Full Speed’ was being sent and a disconnect happened, the user would lose control of the vehicle, turning it into a full ‘autopilot full speed ahead’ Go-Kart. In turn, sending a consistent 0xA value for a given time allows for the slave MSP to know that the other MSP is still alive, which we called the heartbeat timer. This idea is seen throughout many communication devices, even in the MSP432 as the Watchdog Timer.</p><p>A minor problem was receiving garbage data from time to time. This is solved by fixing the configuration of bluetooths and UART for MSP’s to all transmit at the same baud rate. However, a safety measure had to be implemented. We sorted specific numbers out and considered them garbage when receiving. A checksum function was being implemented as an additional safety check but never completed due to hardware faults. With this function and hardware implementation, we could have accurately known if we were receiving non-garbage data and/or having an encoder to see if we were spinning at the same speed for both wheels.</p><p>We originally had LCD configured which worked as advertised. However, this was removed since the speed of the data being transmission was heavily affected. There are specific changes that TI made in order to speed up the frames per second that the LCD could output at. While disabling the clock and frequency changes that TI implemented, the output data still was too fast which a huge delay for every output. In turn, the idea was scrapped.</p><p>We achieved our goals at the end of the day. With a safe and reliable Electric Go-Kart that was tested going down the path from the Engineering Center to Fleming and back, the Electric Go-Kart had no problems turning, going straight, and so forth. There are of course new design implementations that could always be added, but for now, we all are happy with the outcome of this project.</p><p>Overall, this project was really stressful. Being able to do a project as ambitious as we originally planned (which included more than the actual) and aiming for the first prize was a lot to do in 5 weeks. We took barely any breaks, stayed up till 4 am consistently, and skipped class to get this to work. It was a really good learning experience overall and we learned a lot through this Electro-Kart. Now, time to fix our sleep schedule</p><h3 id="appendix" tabindex="-1">Appendix: <a class="header-anchor" href="#appendix" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Appendix:&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Bill of Materials:</p><ul><li>12V Battery/20Ah - $35</li><li>3x PCB, Voltage Regulator Components, Wires - $20</li><li>3x Bluetooth HC-05 Modules - $25</li><li>2x MSP432P401R - $22</li><li>MSP432 BoosterPack Mark II - $40</li><li>2x DPDT, SPST Switches - $15</li><li>10x Bandages - $1</li><li>Wood/Plasterboard - 40$</li><li>Metal Frame - 100$</li><li>Robot Components - &lt;500$</li><li><em><strong>Disclaimer: We already had most of the expensive parts</strong></em></li></ul></div></div></main><footer class="VPDocFooter" data-v-39b3cdb2 data-v-10d8714f><!--[--><!--]--><!----><!----></footer><!--[--><!--]--></div></div></div><!--[--><!--]--></div></div><!----><!--[--><!--]--></div></div>
